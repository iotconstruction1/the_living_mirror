# The Living Mirror

**The Living Mirror** is a soul-driven wellness and transformation app that uses an evolving avatar to reflect the user’s emotional, spiritual, mental, and physical growth. It is designed to help people overcome addiction, restructure habits, and discover a higher purpose.

## 💠 Core System

The app operates using two parallel frameworks:

### 🔹 1. Nodes (Back-end Logic)
Each of the 13 Nodes processes a part of the user’s journey:
- **Node 1:** Core Witness (receives all input)
- **Node 2:** Emotion Detection
- **Node 3:** Adaptive Memory
- **Node 4:** Feedback System
- **Node 5–8:** Growth Process (transformation, meaning, reflection)
- **Node 9:** Avatar Output / Expression

### 🔹 2. Realms (Front-end Experience)
User-facing portals that explore:
- **Emotional**
- **Intellectual**
- **Physical**
- **Social**
- **Spiritual**

Each realm produces interactive games, reflections, and tasks.

## 🔮 Avatar
The avatar represents your future self. It evolves based on:
- Your input
- Emotional integrity
- Progress in realms
- Reflections stored over time
